<h1>Pencil Code Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Pencil Code is a service intended for use by all ages, so
our users' privacy and safety are very important to us.
To protect the privacy of all our users, we limit what we collect
and what we publish on the service.  Pencil Code policies
are in accordance with the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a> that limits use of children's
personally identifiable information online.

<h2>Using Pencil Code</h2>

<p>You can see, create, edit, and run programs with Pencil Code
without registering.  However, if you want to save your own projects
on the Pencil Code service, you must register for an account.

<p>When you register for an account, we ask that you do not use your
real name as an account name.  (Do not use your first and last name
on the service, because you are not allowed to post personally
identifiable information.)

<p>The account name that you choose will be used as the name
for a public website created to publish your programs.
Pencil Code does not function as a personal messaging system.
There is no way for another user to contact you
through your Pencil Code account name.

<h2>Posting Personally Identifiable Information is Not Allowed</h2>

<p>Pencil Code does not collect personally identifiable
information, and our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> expressly
prohibit posting personally identifiable information.  That
means you are not allowed to post content containing your own
full name or the full name of other users, contact information,
addresses, or other identifying information.
We will remove personally identifiable information that we find
on the service.

<p>Teachers and other adults who need to post contact information
or other personally identifying information are encouraged to use
other services to host that content.

<h2>Posted Content is Public</h2>

<p>One of the missions of Pencil Code is to nurture a community
of students who learn from each other, so
all content posted on Pencil Code is shared with all
other users of Pencil Code.  Other users may copy and share
information that you post.

<h2>Changing Your Password and Deleting Your Account</h2>

<p>You can change your password or delete your account at any time.
To delete your account, simply delete all the files in your account.
Empty accounts will be removed within a day or two.
If you have forgotten your password or if you need to delete
your (or your child's) account and you need help,
email <a href="http://mailto:david.bau@gmail.com">david.bau@gmail.com</a>,
and David will reset the password or delete the account.

<h2>Cookies and Local Data</h2>

<p>We put "cookies" on your computer to identify your computer when
you use Pencil Code.  The cookies are used to remember you when you are
logged in; to help you find your previous work when you leave and
return to Pencil Code; and to help the Pencil Code Foundation
understand how students use the service.

<p>Pencil Code saves backups of your data on your local computer to
help safeguard your programs when the network is unreliable.

<p>Pencil Code can be operated with cookies disabled in your browser,
but you may need to log in and provide your password again
each time you wish to save.

<h2>Research and Analytics</h2>

<p>When you save, edit, view, and run projects on Pencil Code, information is
collected to facilitate analysis and improvement of the service.
A record is saved of your interactions with Pencil Code and the state of
your project when you run it.

<p>Some of this data may be used in research studies intended to
improve our understanding of how people learn with the system.
The results of this research may be shared with educators and
researchers through conferences, journals, and other publications.


<h2>About This Policy</h2>
The Pencil Code Foundation continually develops and improves the
service.
In the future Pencil Code may modify this policy to, for example,
reflect changes to
the Service or reflect changes to the law.
You should look at the privacy policy regularly.
