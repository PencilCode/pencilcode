<h1>The Pencil Code Team</h1>

<p>The Pencil Code Team is devoted to advancing computer
science education by making programming as simple and as
universal as using a pencil.

<p>Our project grew out of an open-source hobby and
a collaboration between Googler David Bau, his son Anthony, and
a group of friends.

<p>Before <a href="//pencilcode.net">pencilcode.net</a>,
we had created a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020210113129/http://notesbydave.com/htmlpad/script.htm">series of</a>
<a href="http://dabbler.org/home/00-about/00-README.html">online</a>
<a href="http://js.dabbler.org/">programming tools</a> which we
used to teach Javascript at a variety of urban and suburban
classrooms.

<p>Each time we taught, we learned what was hard, we
watched where the tool got in the way, and we built a better
tool the next time.
Pencil Code is the 5th iteration.

<p>When the version simplifying CoffeeScript
was picked up by David's brother's school
for use in many of their classrooms, David realized it filled
a need.  (David's brother Kevin teaches math at Beaver Country Day,
home of the <a href=
"http://bcdschool.org/tag/coded-curriculum/">coded curriculum</a>.)

<p>The latest addition was a dual-mode block and text editor
(<a href="https://github.com/droplet-editor/droplet"
>Droplet</a>) created by Anthony Bau.  It was inspired by
Hal Abelson's observation that perceived
differences between blocks and text were a
significant problem, a gap that Droplet now
bridges beautifully.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p>Pencil Code is the work of many of
devoted students, teachers, open-source
contributors, and volunteers.  We welcome
your participation too: here is
our <a href="http://dev.pencilcode.net/"
>contributor's portal</a>.

<p><b>David Bau</b>
is a part-time programmer at Google who is
beginning work on a late-career PhD at MIT.
At Google, David helped create
Google Talk (now called Hangouts) and
algorithms for Google Search and Google Image Search.
Prior to his ten years at Google, David built
Internet Explorer and .NET platform tools at
Microsoft and open-source Java enterprise tools
at Crossgain and BEA Systems.  He is a volunteer
teacher with Citizen Schools, and he is
coauthor of a textbook on numerical linear algebra.
Google uses Pencil Code in its computer science
outreach programs, and it generously supports
David's open-source contributions.

<p><b>Anthony Bau</b>
is a high school student at
Phillips Exeter Academy and president of the
Exeter Computing Club. He runs HackExeter,
a precollege hackathon, and he teaches a
Junior Computing Club for middle schoolers.
Prior to Exeter, Anthony was a member of the
Lincoln Gear Ticks, national winners at the
2011 First Lego League robotics championship.
Anthony learned to program using Scratch, Python,
and Javascript, and he created Droplet based
on those experiences. Code.org uses Droplet
in its CSP curriculum tool, and it supports
Anthony through an internship for his
open-source contributions to Droplet.

<p>Pencil Code is an open-source project that builds on
Iced CoffeeScript, a langage created by <b>Jeremy Ashkenas</b>
and <b>Max Krohn</b>, and on many other open source libraries.
Pencil Code is only possible because
of the inventiveness and generosity of the vibrant
Javascript open source community.  The libraries
that we incorporate under open licenses are listed
