This top section ("down to var model = window.pencilcode.model = {") is loading in all the other files of Pencilcode and getting ready for using them in the rest of the file.

model is being built as a nulled out object which will later be filled out

The rest of these functions will be commented inline, anything that should be noted across the entire file will be put in this file. 

view.on is from the view.js file, it sets up event listeners generally as on click functionality
